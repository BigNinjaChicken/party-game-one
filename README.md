# Rounds On Me (party-game-one)
This repo contains the web framework that allows players of Rounds On Me to use their phone as the controller. Rounds On Me aimes at creating a drinking party game that combines drinking with friendly sentence quipping. The system operates similarly to Kahoot, with a central game hosted by Unreal, and the players using their cell phones as controllers.
